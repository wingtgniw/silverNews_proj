주제: Refractive Errors

The cornea and lens of your eye helps you focus.  Refractive errors are vision problems that happen when the shape of the eye keeps you from focusing well. The cause could be the length of the eyeball (longer or shorter), changes in the shape of the cornea, or aging of the lens.Four common refractive errors are:Myopia, or nearsightedness - clear vision close up but  blurry in the distanceHyperopia, or farsightedness - clear vision in the distance but blurry 
close upPresbyopia - inability to focus close up as a result of agingAstigmatism - focus problems caused by the corneaThe most common symptom is blurred vision. Other symptoms may include double vision, haziness, glare or halos around bright lights, squinting, headaches, or eye strain.Glasses or contact lenses can usually correct refractive errors. Laser eye surgery may also be a possibility.NIH: National Eye Institute
