주제: Amyloidosis

Amyloidosis occurs when abnormal proteins called amyloids build up and form deposits. The deposits can collect in organs such as the kidney and heart. This can cause the organs to become stiff and unable to work the way they should. There are three main types of amyloidosis:Primary - with no known causeSecondary - caused by another disease, including some types of cancerFamilial - passed down through genesSymptoms can vary, depending upon which organs are affected. Treatment depends on the type of amyloidosis you have.  The goal is to help with symptoms and limit the production of proteins. If another disease is the cause, it needs to be treated.
