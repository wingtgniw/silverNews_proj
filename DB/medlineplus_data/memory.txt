주제: Memory

Every day, you have different experiences and you learn new things. Your brain cannot store all of that information, so it has to decide what is worth remembering. Memory is the process of storing and then remembering this information. There are different types of memory. Short-term memory stores information for a few seconds or minutes. Long-term memory stores it for a longer period of time.Memory doesn't always work perfectly. As you grow older, it may take longer to remember things.It's normal to forget things once in a while. We've all forgotten a name, where we put our keys, or if we locked the front door. If you are an older adult who forgets things more often than others your age, you may have mild cognitive impairment. Forgetting how to use your phone or find your way home may be signs of a more serious problem, such as:Alzheimer's diseaseOther types of dementiaStrokeDepressionHead injuriesBlood clots or tumors in the brainKidney, liver, or thyroid problemsReactions to certain medicinesIf you're worried about your forgetfulness, see your health care provider.NIH: National Institute on Aging
