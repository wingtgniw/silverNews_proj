When these symptoms get worse than usual, it is called an asthma attack or flare-up.What causes asthma?The exact cause of asthma is unknown. Genetics and your environment likely play a role in who gets asthma.An asthma attack can happen when you are exposed to an asthma trigger. An asthma trigger is something that can set off or worsen your asthma symptoms. Different triggers can cause different types of asthma:Allergic asthma is caused by allergens. Allergens are substances that cause an allergic reaction. They can include
	Dust mitesMoldPetsPollen from grass, trees, and weedsWaste from pests such as cockroaches and mice
Nonallergic asthma is caused by triggers that are not allergens, such as
	Breathing in cold airCertain medicinesHousehold chemicalsInfections such as colds and the fluOutdoor air pollutionTobacco smoke
Occupational asthma is caused by breathing in chemicals or industrial dusts at workExercise-induced asthma happens during physical exercise, especially when the air is dryAsthma triggers may be different for each person and can change over time.Who is at risk for asthma?Asthma affects people of all ages, but it often starts during childhood.

During this test, you inhale different concentrations of allergens or medicines that may tighten the muscles in your airways. Spirometry is done before and after the test.Peak expiratory flow (PEF) tests to measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effortFractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests to measure levels of nitric oxide in your breath when you breathe out. High levels of nitric oxide may mean that your lungs are inflamed.Allergy skin or blood tests, if you have a history of allergies.

If you are an adult with uncontrolled asthma, in some cases your provider might suggest bronchial thermoplasty. This is a procedure that uses heat to shrink the smooth muscle in the lungs. Shrinking the muscle reduces your airway's ability to tighten and allows you to breathe more easily. The procedure has some risks, so it's important to discuss them with your provider.
