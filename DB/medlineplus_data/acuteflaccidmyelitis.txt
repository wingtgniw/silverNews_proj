주제: Acute Flaccid Myelitis

What is acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is a neurologic disease. It is rare, but serious. It affects an area of the spinal cord called gray matter. This can cause the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak.Because of these symptoms, some people call AFM a "polio-like" illness. But it is different from polio. AFM is not caused by polioviruses.What causes acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?AFM can be caused by several different viruses. Researchers think that enteroviruses have been causing the recent increases in the number of children with AFM. AFM can also be caused by other viruses, including flaviviruses, herpesviruses, and adenoviruses.Most people with AFM had a mild respiratory illness or fever (like you would get from a viral infection) before they got AFM.Who is more likely to develop acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?Anyone can get AFM, but most cases (more than 90%) have been in young children.What are the symptoms of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?Most people with AFM will suddenly have:Arm or leg weaknessA loss of muscle tone and reflexesSome people also have other symptoms, including:Facial drooping/weaknessTrouble moving the eyesDrooping eyelidsTrouble swallowingSlurred speechPain in the arms, legs, back, or neckSometimes AFM can weaken the muscles that you need for breathing. This can lead to respiratory failure, which is very serious. If you get respiratory failure, you may need to use a ventilator (breathing machine) to help you breathe.If you or your child develops any of these symptoms, get medical care right away.How is acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) diagnosed?AFM causes many of the same symptoms as other neurologic diseases, such as transverse myelitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome. This can make it difficult to diagnose. To find out if you have AFM, your doctor may use: A neurologic exam, including looking at where there is weakness, poor muscle tone, and decreased reflexesAn MRI to look at the spinal cord and brainLab tests on the cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid around the brain and spinal cord)Nerve conduction and electromyography (EMG) studies. These tests check nerve speed and the response of muscles to the messages from the nerves. It is important that the tests are done as soon as possible after the symptoms start.What are the treatments for acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?There is no specific treatment for AFM. A doctor who specializes in treating brain and spinal cord illnesses (neurologist) may recommend treatments for specific symptoms. For example, physical and/or occupational therapy may help with arm or leg weakness. Researchers do not know the long-term outcomes of people who get AFM.Can acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) be prevented?There is no specific way to prevent AFM. But you can take steps to prevent getting sick from a virus by:Washing your hands often with soap and waterAvoiding touching your face with unwashed handsAvoiding close contact with people who are sickCleaning and disinfecting surfaces that you frequently touch, including toysCovering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or upper shirt sleeve, not handsStaying home when sickCenters for Disease Control and Prevention
