Acne is a common skin disease that causes pimples. Pimples form when hair follicles 
under your skin clog up. Most pimples form on the face, neck, back, chest, and shoulders. Anyone can get acne, but 
it is common in teenagers and young adults. It is not serious, but it can cause scars.No one knows exactly what causes acne. Hormone changes, such as those during the teenage 
years and pregnancy, probably play a role. There are many myths about what causes acne. Chocolate and greasy foods are often 
blamed, but there is little evidence that foods have much effect on acne in most people. 
Another common myth is that dirty skin causes acne; however, blackheads and pimples are not 
caused by dirt. Stress doesn't cause acne, but stress can make it worse.If you have acne:	Clean your skin gently 	Try not to touch your skin 	Avoid the sun Treatments for acne include medicines and creams.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin
