주제: Acoustic Neuroma

An acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor that develops on the nerve that connects the ear to the brain. The tumor usually grows slowly. As it grows, it presses against the hearing and balance nerves. At first, you may have no symptoms or mild symptoms. They can include: Loss of hearing on one side  Ringing in ears Dizziness and balance problemsThe tumor can also eventually cause numbness or paralysis of the face. If it grows large enough, it can press against the brain, becoming life-threatening.Acoustic neuroma can be difficult to diagnose, because the symptoms are similar to those of middle ear problems.  Ear exams, hearing tests, and scans can show if you have it.If the tumor stays small, you may only need to have it checked regularly.  If you do need treatment, surgery and radiation are options.If the tumors affect both hearing nerves, it is often because of a genetic disorder called neurofibromatosis.NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Communication Disorders
