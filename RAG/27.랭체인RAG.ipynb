AFM causes many of the same symptoms as other neurologic \\ndiseases, such as transverse myelitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome. This can make it \\ndifficult to diagnose. To find out if you have AFM, your doctor may use: A neurologic \\nexam, including looking at where there is weakness, poor muscle tone, and decreased \\nreflexes. An MRI to look at the spinal cord and brain. Lab tests on the cerebrospinal fluid \\n(the fluid around the brain and spinal cord). Nerve conduction and electromyography \\n(EMG) studies. These tests check nerve speed and the response of muscles to the \\nmessages from the nerves. It is important that the tests are done as soon as possible \\nafter the symptoms start. What are the treatments for acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)? There \\nis no specific treatment for AFM. A doctor who specializes in treating brain and spinal \\ncord illnesses (neurologist) may recommend treatments for specific symptoms.

Each type of cell \\nhas a different job. White blood cells help your body fight infection. Red blood cells \\ndeliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs. Platelets help form clots to \\nstop bleeding. When you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of \\nabnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal \\ncells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells \\nand make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work.

They also crowd out the healthy cells, which can \\nlead to infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. These abnormal cells can also spread to \\nother parts of the body, including the brain and spinal cord. What causes acute \\nlymphocytic leukemia (ALL)? ALL happens when there are changes in the genetic material \\n(DNA) in bone marrow cells. The cause of these genetic changes is unknown. However, \\nthere are certain factors that raise your risk of ALL. Who is at risk for acute lymphocytic \\nleukemia (ALL)? The factors that raise your risk of ALL include. Being male.

Leukemia starts in \\nblood-forming tissues such as the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes the cells \\nwhich will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell \\nhas a different job: White blood cells help your body fight infection, Red blood cells \\ndeliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs Platelets help form clots to \\nstop bleeding. When you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of \\nabnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal \\ncells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells \\nand make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work. What is acute myeloid \\nleukemia (AML)? Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of acute leukemia. \"Acute\" \\nmeans that the leukemia usually gets worse quickly if it\\'s not treated. In AML, the bone \\nmarrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or \\nplatelets. When the abnormal cells crowd out the healthy cells, it can lead to infection, \\nanemia, and easy bleeding. The abnormal cells can also spread outside the blood to \\nother parts of the body. There are several different subtypes of AML. The subtypes are \\nbased on how developed the cancer cells are when you get your diagnosis and how \\ndifferent they are from normal cells. What causes acute myeloid leukemia (AML)? AML \\nhappens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. \\nThe cause of these genetic changes is unknown. However, there are certain factors that \\nraise your risk of AML. Who is at risk for acute myeloid leukemia (AML)? The factors that \\nraise your risk of AML include: Being male Smoking, especially after age 60Having had \\nchemotherapy or radiation therapy Treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as \\na child Exposure to the chemical benzene. A history of another blood disorder such as \\nmyelodysplastic syndrome.

Adenoids are a patch of tissue that is high up in the throat, just \\nbehind the nose. They, along with the tonsils, are part of the lymphatic system. The \\nlymphatic system clears away infection and keeps body fluids in balance. The adenoids \\nand tonsils work by trapping germs coming in through the mouth and nose. Adenoids \\nusually start to shrink after about age 5. By the teenage years, they are almost \\ncompletely gone. By then, the body has other ways to fight germs. What are enlarged \\nadenoids?

To find out if your child has \\nenlarged adenoids, the health care provider will Ask about your child's medical history, \\nincluding asking about your child's symptoms Check your child's ears, throat, and mouth. \\nFeel your child's neck, Since the adenoids are higher up than the throat, the provider \\ncannot see them just by looking through your child's mouth.  To check the size of your \\nchild's adenoids, your provider may use A special mirror in the mouth. A long, flexible \\ntube with a light (an endoscope) An x-ray. What are the treatments for enlarged \\nadenoids? The treatment depends on what is causing the problem. If the symptoms are \\nnot too bad, your child may not need treatment. If treatment is needed, your child may \\nget nasal spray to reduce the swelling or antibiotics if the provider thinks that there is a \\nbacterial infection. In some cases, your child may need an adenoidectomy. What is an \\nadenoidectomy and why might I my child need one? An adenoidectomy is surgery to \\nremove the adenoids.

Angioplasty is a procedure to improve blood flow in coronary \\narteries that have become narrow or blocked. Your coronary arteries supply oxygen-rich \\nblood to your heart. If you have coronary artery disease, a sticky material called plaque \\nbuilds up in your coronary arteries. Plaque is made of cholesterol, calcium, and other \\nsubstances in your blood. Over time, it can narrow your arteries or fully block them. \\nWhen this happens, some parts of your heart don't get enough blood. Angioplasty \\nwidens the blocked part of your artery so more blood can get through. It is also called \\npercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). \\n \\nWhat conditions does angioplasty treat? Doctors (usually a heart specialist called a \\ncardiologist) use angioplasty to Reduce chest pain from blockages in the coronary \\narteries. This type of pain is called angina. There are different types of angina. \\nAngioplasty treats certain types. Limit damage to the heart during or right after a heart \\nattack. In this case, angioplasty is an emergency treatment. Angioplasty does not cure \\ncoronary artery disease. To help prevent more plaque blockages, you'll need to take any \\nprescribed medicines, eat healthy foods, and get regular exercise. What happens during \\nangioplasty? Most people have angioplasties in a hospital in a special room called a \\ncardiac catheterization, or cath, lab. You will be awake and lying down. You'll get \\nmedicine to help you relax through an intravenous (IV) line. This is a small tube that \\ngoes into a vein in your hand or arm. Angioplasty is done through a blood vessel in your \\narm, wrist, or groin. Your doctor will Make a small opening in that area to insert a thin \\ntube (a catheter) into a blood vessel. Thread the tube through the vessel to your heart, \\nusing x-rays as a guide. Inject contrast dye inside your arteries. The dye highlights your \\nheart and blood vessels in the x-rays. Replace the first tube with another one that has a \\nsmall, deflated balloon on the end. Guide the balloon inside the blockage and inflate it \\nto push the plaque flat against the artery wall. This makes the artery wider and improves \\nblood flow. Sometimes put a small, mesh tube into the artery to help keep it open. The \\ntube is called a stent. Some stents have a coating of medicine that helps prevent blood \\nclots from forming. What happens after an angioplasty? If you had an angioplasty for \\nchest pain, you'll go to a recovery room for a few hours. You may stay in the hospital \\novernight.

But it can be a long-term condition. There's no cure, but \\ntreatment may help improve language skills. What causes aphasia? Aphasia happens \\nfrom damage to one or more parts of the brain involved with language. The damage \\nmay be from: Stroke, which is the most common cause of aphasia Brain tumor, Brain \\ninfection or inflammation, Brain injury, Other brain disorders or neurologic diseases that \\naffect the brain and get worse over time, such as dementia. Who is more likely to \\ndevelop aphasia? Anyone can have aphasia at any age, but most people with aphasia are \\nmiddle-aged or older. Most aphasia happens suddenly from a stroke or brain injury. \\nAphasia from a brain tumor or other brain disorder may develop slowly over time. How \\nis aphasia diagnosed? If a health care provider sees signs of aphasia, the provider will \\nusually: Test the person's ability to understand language and speech. This includes asking \\nquestions and checking to see if the person can follow simple commands. Order an \\nimaging scan to see if there's a brain injury and what part of the brain is damaged. \\nPossible tests include: \\n \\nMRICT scan \\nIf imaging shows signs of aphasia, more tests may be needed. These tests measure how \\nmuch the brain damage has affected the ability to talk, read, write, and understand. In \\nmost cases, the tests are done by a speech-language pathologist or speech therapist (a \\nspecialist who treats speech and communication disorders). What are the treatments for \\naphasia? Some people fully recover from aphasia without treatment. But most people \\nshould begin speech-language therapy to treat aphasia as soon as possible. Treatment \\nmay be one-on-one with a speech therapist or in a group. Therapy using a computer \\nmay also be helpful. The specific therapy depends on the type of language loss that a \\nperson has. It may include exercises in reading, writing, following directions, and \\nrepeating what the therapist says. Therapy may also include learning how to \\ncommunicate with gestures, pictures, smartphones, or other electronic devices. Family \\nparticipation may be an important part of speech therapy. Family members can learn to \\nhelp with recovery in many ways, such as Using simpler language Including the person \\nwith aphasia in conversations, Repeating or writing down key words to help \\ncommunicate more clearly.

It affects your airways, the \\ntubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. When you have asthma, your airways can \\nbecome inflamed and narrowed. This can cause wheezing, coughing, and tightness in \\nyour chest. When these symptoms get worse than usual, it is called an asthma attack or \\nflare-up. How does asthma affect children? Asthma often starts during childhood, usually \\nbefore age 5. Many children have asthma - it is the most common chronic disease of \\nchildhood. It can cause children to miss school and end up in the hospital. But \\ntreatments can help manage asthma. What causes asthma in children? The exact cause \\nof asthma is unknown. Genetics and environment likely play a role in which children get \\nasthma. An asthma attack can happen when your child is exposed to an asthma trigger. \\nAn asthma trigger is something that can set off or worsen asthma symptoms. Different \\ntriggers can cause different types of asthma. Allergic asthma is caused by allergens. \\nAllergens are substances that cause an allergic reaction. They can include dust mites, \\nmold pets pollen from grass, trees, and weeds.

And if you have one autoimmune disease, you are more likely to get \\nanother. What are the symptoms of autoimmune diseases? The symptoms of an \\nautoimmune disease depend on the part of your body that's affected. Many types of \\nautoimmune diseases cause redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which are the signs and \\nsymptoms of inflammation.  But other il lnesses can cause the same symptoms.

People with \\nsevere illness from bird flu may have pneumonia and might need to be hospitalized. \\nHow is bird flu diagnosed? Laboratory testing is used to diagnose bird flu. It's usually \\ndone with a nasal or throat swab. This testing is more accurate when the swab is \\ncollected during the first few days of illness. For people who are severely ill, health care \\nproviders may do testing of a different sample, such as fluid taken during a \\nbronchoalveolar lavage or other procedure.

Some birth defects like \\ncleft lip or neural tube defects are structural problems that can be easy to see. Others, \\nlike heart disease, are found using special tests. Birth defects can range from mild to \\nsevere. How a birth defect affects a child\\'s life depends mostly on which organ or body \\npart is involved and how severe the defect is. What causes birth defects? For some birth \\ndefects, researchers know the cause. But for many birth defects, the exact cause is \\nunknown. Researchers think that most birth defects are caused by a complex mix of \\nfactors, which can include genetics. One or more genes might have a change or \\nmutation that prevents them from working properly. For example, this happens in Fragile \\nX syndrome. With some defects, a gene or part of the gene might be missing. \\nChromosomal problems. In some cases, a chromosome or part of a chromosome might \\nbe missing. This is what happens in Turner syndrome. In other cases, such as with Down \\nsyndrome, the child has an extra chromosome. Exposures to medicines, chemicals, or \\nother toxic substances. For example, alcohol misuse can cause fetal alcohol spectrum \\ndisorders. Infections during pregnancy.

The liquid part, called plasma, is made of \\nwater, salts, and protein. Over half of your blood is plasma. The solid part of your blood \\ncontains red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Red blood cells (RBC) deliver \\noxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs. White blood cells (WBC) fight \\ninfection and are part of your immune system. Platelets help blood to clot when you \\nhave a cut or wound. Bone marrow, the spongy material inside your bones, makes new \\nblood cells. Blood cells constantly die and your body makes new ones. Red blood cells \\nlive about 120 days, and platelets live about 6 days. Some white blood cells live less than \\na day, but others live much longer. There are four blood types: A, B, AB, or O. Also, \\nblood is either Rh-positive or Rh-negative. So if you have type A blood, it\\'s either A \\npositive or A negative. Which type you are is important if you need a blood transfusion. \\nAnd your Rh factor could be important if you become pregnant - an incompatibility \\nbetween your type and the baby\\'s could create problems.

Healthy lifestyle changes can help reduce \\nhigh blood pressure, losing weight, being physically active managing stress, reducing \\nsodium in your diet, avoiding alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs, getting enough sleep. \\nWhat if lifestyle changes alone cannot lower blood pressure? Sometimes lifestyle changes \\nalone cannot control or lower your high blood pressure. In that case, your health care \\nprovider may prescribe blood pressure medicines. How do blood pressure medicines \\nwork? The most commonly used blood pressure medicines work in different ways to \\nlower blood pressure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II \\nreceptor blockers (ARBs) keep your blood vessels from narrowing as much and allows \\nblood to move through them with less pressure. Beta blockers help your heart beat \\nslower and with less force. This means that your heart pumps less blood through your \\nblood vessels. Beta blockers are typically used only as a backup option or if you also \\nhave certain other conditions. Calcium channel blockers prevent calcium from entering \\nthe muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows the blood vessels to relax. \\nDiuretics remove extra water and sodium (salt) from your body. This lowers the amount \\nof fluid in your blood. Diuretics are often used with other high blood pressure medicines, \\nsometimes in one combined pill. Often, two or more medicines work better than one.

CAD happens \\nwhen the arteries that supply blood to heart muscle become hardened and narrowed. \\nThis is due to the buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner \\nwalls. This buildup is called atherosclerosis. As it grows, less blood can flow through the \\narteries. As a result, the heart muscle can't get the blood or oxygen it needs. This can \\nlead to chest pain (angina) or a heart attack.  Most heart attacks happen when a blood \\nclot suddenly cuts off the hearts' blood supply, causing permanent heart damage.  Over \\ntime, CAD can also weaken the heart muscle and contribute to heart failure and \\narrhythmias. Heart failure means the heart can't pump blood well to the rest of the body. \\nArrhythmias are changes in the normal beating rhythm of the heart.

Healthy lifestyle changes can help reduce \\nhigh blood pressure losing weight, being physically active, managing stress, reducing \\nsodium in your diet, avoiding alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs, getting enough sleep. \\nWhat if lifestyle changes alone cannot lower blood pressure? Sometimes lifestyle changes \\nalone cannot control or lower your high blood pressure. In that case, your health care \\nprovider may prescribe blood pressure medicines. How do blood pressure medicines \\nwork? The most commonly used blood pressure medicines work in different ways to \\nlower blood pressure angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II \\nreceptor blockers (ARBs) keep your blood vessels from narrowing as much and allows \\nblood to move through them with less pressure. Beta blockers help your heart beat \\nslower and with less force. This means that your heart pumps less blood through your \\nblood vessels. Beta blockers are typically used only as a backup option or if you also \\nhave certain other conditions. Calcium channel blockers prevent calcium from entering \\nthe muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows the blood vessels to relax. \\nDiuretics remove extra water and sodium (salt) from your body. This lowers the amount \\nof fluid in your blood. Diuretics are often used with other high blood pressure medicines, \\nsometimes in one combined pill. Often, two or more medicines work better than one. If \\nthese medicines do not lower your blood pressure enough, your provider may suggest \\nthat you take another type of blood pressure medicine.

Nonalcoholic \\nsteatohepatitis (NASH), in which you have inflammation and liver cell damage, as well as \\nfat in your liver. Inflammation and liver cell damage can cause fibrosis, or scarring, of the \\nliver. NASH may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer. What is alcoholic fatty liver disease? \\nAlcoholic fatty liver disease is due to heavy alcohol use. Your liver breaks down most of \\nthe alcohol you drink, so it can be removed from your body. But the process of breaking \\nit down can generate harmful substances. These substances can damage liver cells, \\npromote inflammation, and weaken your body's natural defenses.

In some cases, you may also need a liver biopsy to confirm the \\ndiagnosis, and to check how bad the liver damage is. What are the treatments for fatty \\nliver disease? Doctors recommend weight loss for nonalcoholic fatty liver. Weight loss \\ncan reduce fat in the liver, inflammation, and fibrosis.

A food allergy is an abnormal immune system reaction to certain \\nfoods. Your immune system normally protects you from germs.

But in some cases, it can be serious or even life-threatening. \\nA food intolerance is different than a food allergy. If you have a food intolerance, you \\nalso have symptoms when you eat that food. But these are typically just digestive \\nsymptoms such as bloating and gas. Also, an intolerance is not an immune system \\nreaction. Most food allergies are caused by cow\\'s milk, chicken eggs, crustacean shellfish, \\nsuch as shrimp, crab, lobster, and crayfish, fish peanuts, sesame soy, tree nuts, such as \\nalmonds, walnuts, pecans wheat.

Children who \\nhave too little of it may be very short. Treatment with growth hormone can stimulate \\ngrowth. People can also have too much growth hormone. Usually the cause is a pituitary \\ngland tumor, which is not cancer.  Too much growth hormone can cause gigantism in \\nchildren, where their bones and their body grow too much.

The valves have flaps that open and close. The flaps make sure that \\nblood flows in the right direction through your heart and to the rest of your body. When \\nyour heart beats, the flaps open to let blood through. Between heartbeats they close to \\nstop the blood from flowing backwards. If one or more of your heart valves doesn't \\nopen or close correctly, it can affect your blood flow and strain your heart. Fortunately, \\ntreatment helps most valve diseases. What are the types of heart valve diseases? Heart \\nvalves can have three basic kinds of problems such as regurgitation, or backflow, \\nhappens when the flaps of a valve don't close tightly. This allows the blood to leak \\nbackwards. A common cause of regurgitation is prolapse, where the flaps of the valve \\nflop or bulge back. Prolapse most often affects the mitral valve. Stenosis happens when \\nthe flaps of a valve become thick, stiff, or stuck together. This prevents the heart valve \\nfrom opening all the way. Not enough blood can pass through the valve. Aortic valve \\nstenosis is a common type of stenosis. It affects the valve that controls blood flow into \\nthe large artery that carries blood out of the heart to the body. Atresia happens when a \\nheart valve did not form properly and does not have an opening for blood to pass \\nthrough. Sometimes a valve can have both regurgitation and stenosis. What causes heart \\nvalve diseases? Some people are born with heart valve disease. This is called congenital \\nheart valve disease. It can happen alone or along with other congenital heart defects. \\nHeart valve disease can also develop over time as you get older or have certain \\nconditions that affect the heart. Who is more likely to develop heart valve diseases? Your \\nchance of having heart valve disease is higher if you are older. With age, the heart valves \\ncan become thick and stiff. You have or have had other conditions that affect your heart \\nand blood vessels. These include: \\nRheumatic fever. An untreated strep throat can become rheumatic fever, which can harm \\nthe heart valves. The damage may not show up for years.

If you don't get treatment for heart valve disease, the symptoms \\nand strain on your heart may keep getting worse. What other problems can heart valve \\ndiseases cause? When the valves don't work well, your heart has to pump harder to get \\nenough blood out to the body.  Without treatment, this extra workload on your heart \\ncan lead to heart failure, stroke blood clots, sudden cardiac arrest or death. How is heart \\nvalve disease diagnosed? Your health care provider may listen to your heart with a \\nstethoscope and hear that your heart makes abnormal sounds, such as a click or a heart \\nmurmur. These sounds may mean a valve isn't working normally. The provider will \\nusually refer you to a cardiologist, a doctor who specializes in heart diseases. The doctor \\nwill also listen to your heart and will do a physical exam. You will also likely need to have \\none or more heart tests. What are the treatments for heart valve diseases? Most heart \\nvalve problems can be treated successfully. Treatment may include medicines to control \\nyour symptoms and keep your heart pumping well, heart-healthy lifestyle changes to \\ntreat other related heart conditions, surgery to repair or replace a valve. It's possible that \\nyou may need surgery, even if you don't have symptoms. Fixing the valve can help \\nprevent future heart problems. There are many ways to do heart valve surgery. You and \\nyour doctor can decide what's best for you, based on your valve problem and general \\nhealth. Heart valve repair surgery has fewer risks than heart valve replacement. So, when \\nrepair is possible, it's preferred over valve replacement. In some cases, valve replacement \\nis necessary. There are 2 types of replacement valves such as biologic valves made from \\npig, cow, or human tissue. These valves tend to wear out after 10 to 15 years, but some \\nmay last longer. Mechanical (human-made) valves usually don't wear out. But with a \\nmechanical valve, you usually have to take blood thinners for the rest of your life to \\nprevent blood clots.

There are two kinds simple fatty liver, in which you have fat \\nin your liver but little or no inflammation or liver cell damage. Simple fatty liver typically \\ndoes not get bad enough to cause liver damage or complications. Nonalcoholic \\nsteatohepatitis (NASH), in which you have inflammation and liver cell damage, as well as \\nfat in your liver. Inflammation and liver cell damage can cause fibrosis, or scarring, of the \\nliver. NASH may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer. What is alcoholic fatty liver disease? \\nAlcoholic fatty liver disease is due to heavy alcohol use. Your liver breaks down most of \\nthe alcohol you drink, so it can be removed from your body. But the process of breaking \\nit down can generate harmful substances. These substances can damage liver cells, \\npromote inflammation, and weaken your body's natural defenses. The more alcohol that \\nyou drink, the more you damage your liver.  Alcoholic fatty liver disease is the earliest \\nstage of alcohol-related liver disease. The next stages are alcoholic hepatitis and \\ncirrhosis. Who is at risk for fatty liver disease? The cause of nonalcoholic fatty liver \\ndisease (NAFLD) is unknown. Researchers know that it is more common among people \\nwith type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, or obesity, as well as those who are middle-aged or \\nolder (though children can also be affected). It is most frequent in Hispanic individuals, \\nfollowed by non-Hispanic Whites. It is less common in African Americans.

As part of the medical history, your doctor \\nwill ask about your alcohol use, to find out whether fat in your liver is a sign of alcoholic \\nfatty liver disease or nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD). He or she will also ask which \\nmedicines you take, to try to determine whether a medicine is causing your NAFLD. \\nDuring the physical exam, your doctor will examine your body and check your weight \\nand height. Your doctor will look for signs of fatty liver disease, such as an enlarged liver \\nsigns of cirrhosis, such as jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and whites of your \\neyes to turn yellow. You will likely have blood tests, including liver function tests and \\nblood count tests. In some cases you may also have imaging tests, like those that check \\nfor fat in the liver and the stiffness of your liver. Liver stiffness can mean fibrosis, which is \\nscarring of the liver. In some cases you may also need a liver biopsy to confirm the \\ndiagnosis, and to check how bad the liver damage is. What are the treatments for fatty \\nliver disease? Doctors recommend weight loss for nonalcoholic fatty liver. Weight loss \\ncan reduce fat in the liver, inflammation, and fibrosis. If your doctor thinks that a certain \\nmedicine is the cause of your NAFLD, you should stop taking that medicine.  But check \\nwith your doctor before stopping the medicine. You may need to get off the medicine \\ngradually, and you might need to switch to another medicine instead. There are no \\nmedicines that have been approved to treat NAFLD. Studies are investigating whether a \\ncertain diabetes medicine or Vitamin E can help, but more studies are needed. The most \\nimportant part of treating alcohol-related fatty liver disease is to stop drinking alcohol. If \\nyou need help doing that, you may want to see a therapist or participate in an alcohol \\nrecovery program. There are also medicines that can help, either by reducing your \\ncravings or making you feel sick if you drink alcohol. Both alcoholic fatty liver disease \\nand one type of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) can lead to \\ncirrhosis. Doctors can treat the health problems caused by cirrhosis with medicines, \\noperations, and other medical procedures. If the cirrhosis leads to liver failure, you may \\nneed a liver transplant.

Respiratory failure is a condition in which your blood doesn't \\nhave enough oxygen or has too much carbon dioxide. Sometimes you can have both \\nproblems. When you breathe, your lungs take in oxygen. The oxygen passes into your \\nblood, which carries it to your organs. Your organs, such as your heart and brain, need \\nthis oxygen-rich blood to work well. Another part of breathing is removing the carbon \\ndioxide from the blood and breathing it out. Having too much carbon dioxide in your \\nblood can harm your organs. What causes respiratory failure? Conditions that affect your \\nbreathing can cause respiratory failure. These conditions may affect the muscles, nerves, \\nbones, or tissues that support breathing. Or they may affect the lungs directly. These \\nconditions include diseases that affect the lungs, such as COPD (chronic obstructive \\npulmonary disease), cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and COVID-\\n19Conditions that affect the nerves and muscles that control breathing, such as \\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), muscular dystrophy, spinal cord injuries, and stroke \\nproblems with the spine, such as scoliosis (a curve in the spine). They can affect the \\nbones and muscles used for breathing. Damage to the tissues and ribs around the lungs. \\nAn injury to the chest can cause this damage.

A low oxygen level in \\nthe blood can cause shortness of breath and air hunger (the feeling that you can't \\nbreathe in enough air). Your skin, lips, and fingernails may also have a bluish color. A \\nhigh carbon dioxide level can cause rapid breathing and confusion. Some people who \\nhave respiratory failure may become very sleepy or lose consciousness. They also may \\nhave arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat). You may have these symptoms if your brain and \\nheart are not getting enough oxygen. How is respiratory failure diagnosed? Your health \\ncare provider will diagnose respiratory failure based on your medical history. A physical \\nexam, which often includes listening to your lungs to check for abnormal sounds, \\nlistening to your heart to check for arrhythmia, looking for a bluish color on your skin, \\nlips, and fingernails, diagnostic tests, such as pulse oximetry, a small sensor that uses a \\nlight to measure how much oxygen is in your blood. The sensor goes on the end of your \\nfinger or on your ear. Arterial blood gas test, a test that measures the oxygen and \\ncarbon dioxide levels in your blood. The blood sample is taken from an artery, usually in \\nyour wrist. Once you are diagnosed with respiratory failure, your provider will look for \\nwhat is causing it. Tests for this often include a chest x-ray. If your provider thinks you \\nmay have arrhythmia because of the respiratory failure, you may have an EKG \\n(electrocardiogram). This is simple, painless test that detects and records your heart's \\nelectrical activity. What are the treatments for respiratory failure? Treatment for \\nrespiratory failure depends on whether it is acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing), how \\nsevere it is, and what is causing it. Acute respiratory failure can be a medical emergency. \\nYou may need treatment in intensive care unit at a hospital. Chronic respiratory failure \\ncan often be treated at home. But if your chronic respiratory failure is severe, you might \\nneed treatment in a long-term care center. One of the main goals of treatment is to get \\noxygen to your lungs and other organs and remove carbon dioxide from your body. \\nAnother goal is to treat the cause of the condition. Treatments may include oxygen \\ntherapy, through a nasal cannula (two small plastic tubes that go in your nostrils) or \\nthrough a mask that fits over your nose and mouth. Tracheostomy, a surgically-made \\nhole that goes through the front of your neck and into your windpipe. A breathing tube, \\nalso called a tracheostomy, or trach tube, is placed in the hole to help you breathe. \\nVentilator, a breathing machine that blows air into your lungs. It also carries carbon \\ndioxide out of your lungs. Other breathing treatments, such as noninvasive positive \\npressure ventilation (NPPV), which uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open \\nwhile you sleep.

Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a condition in which \\nthe heart suddenly stops beating. When that happens, blood stops flowing to the brain \\nand other vital organs. If it is not treated, SCA usually causes death within minutes. But \\nquick treatment with a defibrillator may be lifesaving. How is sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) \\ndifferent from a heart attack? A heart attack is different from an SCA. A heart attack \\nhappens when blood flow to the heart is blocked. During a heart attack, the heart usually \\ndoesn't suddenly stop beating. With an SCA, the heart stops beating. Sometimes an SCA \\ncan happen after or during recovery from a heart attack. What causes sudden cardiac \\narrest (SCA)? Your heart has an electrical system that controls the rate and rhythm of \\nyour heartbeat.  An SCA can happen when the heart's electrical system is not working \\nright and causes irregular heartbeats. Irregular heartbeats are called arrhythmias. There \\nare different types. They may cause the heart to beat too fast, too slow, or with an \\nirregular rhythm. Some can cause the heart to stop pumping blood to the body; this is \\nthe type that causes SCA. Certain diseases and conditions can cause the electrical \\nproblems that lead to SCA. They include ventricular fibrillation, a type of arrhythmia \\nwhere the ventricles (the heart's lower chambers) don't beat normally. Instead, they beat \\nvery fast and very irregularly. They can't pump blood to the body. This causes most \\nSCAs. Coronary artery disease (CAD), also called ischemic heart disease. CAD happens \\nwhen the arteries of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart. It is \\noften caused by the buildup of plaque, a waxy substance, inside the lining of larger \\ncoronary arteries. The plaque blocks some or all of the blood flow to the heart. Some \\ntypes of physical stress can cause your heart's electrical system to fail, such as: \\n• Intense physical activity in which your body releases the hormone adrenaline. This \\nhormone can trigger SCA in people who have heart problems. \\n• Very low blood levels of potassium or magnesium, as these minerals play an\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2019', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2019', 'creationdate': '2025-05-14T15:44:39+09:00', 'author': 'Nitrosoft', 'moddate': '2025-05-14T15:44:39+09:00', 'source': 'venv/data/med_data_all.pdf', 'total_pages': 126, 'page': 115, 'page_label': '116'}, page_content=\"important role in your heart's electrical system. \\n• Major blood loss. \\n• Severe lack of oxygen. \\n• Certain inherited disorders, which can cause arrhythmias or problems with the \\nstructure of your heart. \\n• Structural changes in the heart, such as an enlarged heart due to high blood \\npressure or advanced heart disease. Heart infections can also cause changes to \\nthe structure of the heart. \\n \\nYou are at a higher risk for SCA if you: \\n• Have coronary artery disease (CAD). Most people with SCA have CAD, but CAD \\nusually does not cause symptoms, so you may not know that you have it. \\n• Are older, as your risk increases with age. \\n• Are a man, since SCA is more common in men than in women. \\n• Are Black or African American, especially if you have other conditions such as \\ndiabetes, high blood pressure, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. \\n• Have a personal history of irregular heartbeats (arrhythmia). \\n• Have a personal or family history of SCA or inherited disorders that can cause \\narrhythmia. \\n• Have a problem with drug or alcohol use. \\n• Have had a heart attack. \\n• Have heart failure. \\n \\nWhat are the symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? Usually, the first sign of SCA is \\nloss of consciousness (fainting). This happens when the heart stops beating. Some \\npeople may have a racing heartbeat or feel dizzy or light-headed just before they faint. \\nAnd sometimes people have chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting in the \\nhour before they have an SCA. How is sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) diagnosed? SCA \\nhappens without warning and requires emergency treatment. Health care providers rarely \\ndiagnose SCA with medical tests as it's happening. Instead, it is usually diagnosed after it \\nhappens. Providers do this by ruling out other causes of a person's sudden collapse. If \\nyou are at high risk for SCA, your provider may refer you to a cardiologist, a doctor who \\nspecializes in heart diseases.

SCA is an emergency. A person having SCA needs to be treated with a \\ndefibrillator right away. A defibrillator is a device sends an electric shock to the heart. \\nThe electric shock can restore a normal rhythm to a heart that's stopped beating. To \\nwork well, it needs to be done within minutes of the SCA. Most police officers, \\nemergency medical technicians, and other first responders are trained and equipped to \\nuse a defibrillator. Call 9-1-1 right away if someone has signs or symptoms of SCA. The \\nsooner you call for help, the sooner lifesaving treatment can begin. What should I do if I \\nthink that someone has had an SCA? Many public places such as schools, businesses, \\nand airports have automated external defibrillators (AEDs). AEDs are special defibrillators \\nthat untrained people can use if they think that someone has had SCA. AEDS are \\nprogrammed to give an electric shock if they detect a dangerous arrhythmia. This \\nprevents giving a shock to someone who may have fainted but isn't having SCA. If you \\nsee someone who you think has had SCA, you should give cardiopulmonary resuscitation \\n(CPR) until defibrillation can be done. People who are at risk for SCA may want to \\nconsider having an AED at home. Ask your cardiologist to help you decide whether \\nhaving an AED in your home might help you. What are the treatments after surviving \\nsudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? If you survive SCA, you'll likely be admitted to a hospital for \\nongoing care and treatment. In the hospital, your medical team will closely watch your \\nheart. They may give you medicines to try to reduce the risk of another SCA. They will \\nalso try to find out what caused your SCA. If you're diagnosed with coronary artery \\ndisease, you may have an angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery. These \\nprocedures help restore blood flow through narrowed or blocked coronary arteries. \\nOften, people who have had SCA get a device called an implantable cardioverter \\ndefibrillator (ICD). This small device is surgically placed under the skin in your chest or \\nabdomen. An ICD uses electric pulses or shocks to help control dangerous arrhythmias. \\nCan sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) be prevented? You may be able to lower your risk of \\nSCA by following a heart-healthy lifestyle. If you have coronary artery disease or another \\nheart disease, treating that disease can also lower your risk of SCA. If you have had an \\nSCA, getting an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) can lower your chance of \\nhaving another SCA.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. \\n \\nSun Exposure \\nUltraviolet (UV) rays are an invisible form of radiation.

And newborn babies are too young to get some vaccines. Community \\nimmunity can help to protect them all. Are vaccines safe for children? Vaccines are safe. \\nThey must go through extensive safety testing and evaluation before they are approved \\nin the United States. Some people worry that childhood vaccines could cause autism \\nspectrum disorder (ASD). But many scientific studies have looked at this and have found \\nno link between vaccines and autism. Can vaccines overload my child\\'s immune system? \\nNo, vaccines do not overload the immune system. Every day, a healthy child\\'s immune \\nsystem successfully fights off thousands of germs. When your child gets vaccines, they \\nare getting weakened or dead germs. So even if they get several vaccines in one day, \\nthey are being exposed to a tiny amount of germs compared to what they encounter \\nevery day in their environment. When do I need to vaccinate my child? Your child will \\nget vaccines during well-child visits. They will be given according to the vaccine \\nschedule. This schedule lists which vaccines are recommended for children. It includes \\nwho should get the vaccines, how many doses they need, and at what age they should \\nget them. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \\npublishes the vaccine schedule. Following the vaccine schedule allows your child to get \\nprotection from the diseases at exactly the right time. It gives their body the chance to \\nbuild up immunity before being exposed to these very serious diseases. \\n \\nVasculitis \\nVasculitis is an inflammation of the blood vessels. It happens when the body\\'s immune \\nsystem attacks the blood vessel by mistake. It can happen because of an infection, a \\nmedicine, or another disease. The cause is often unknown. Vasculitis can affect arteries, \\nveins and capillaries. Arteries are vessels that carry blood from the heart to the body\\'s \\norgans. Veins are the vessels that carry blood back to the heart. Capillaries are tiny blood \\nvessels that connect the small arteries and veins.

What types of injuries do \\nservice members face? During their service, members are at risk for various injuries. \\nThese injuries can happen during training or while in combat. Sometimes the injuries are \\nlife-threatening or serious enough to cause disability. Others may not be as serious, but \\nthey may be painful and can affect daily life. Some of the specific types of injuries that \\nservice members may face include sprains and strains, especially in the ankles and knees. \\nThese injuries are often caused by exercise and running. Back and shoulder injuries, often \\nfrom lifting and carrying. Tinnitus and hearing loss, typically from exposure to noise. \\nHead injuries and traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). Shrapnel and gunshot wounds. Lost \\nlimbs. What other special health problems do service members face? There may also be \\na risk of health problems from exposure to environmental hazards, such as contaminated \\nwater, chemicals, infections, and burn pits. Sometimes the health problems caused by \\nexposures don't develop until years later. Some service members experience military \\nsexual trauma (MST). This includes sexual assault and sexual harassment. What mental \\nhealth issues do service members and veterans face? Being in combat and being \\nseparated from your family can be stressful. So can readjusting to civilian life after the \\nmilitary. All of this stress can put service members and veterans at risk for mental health \\nproblems, including Depression, Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety alcohol \\nand drug use disorders.

Viruses are very tiny germs. They are made of genetic material (either \\nDNA or RNA) inside of a protein coating. There are a huge number of viruses on earth. \\nOnly a small number of them can infect humans. Those viruses can infect our cells, which \\nmay cause disease. Some of the diseases that viruses can cause include the common \\ncold, the flu, COVID-19. How are viruses spread? Viruses can be spread in different ways, \\nthrough droplets and particles that are breathed out by someone who has the infection. \\nYou might breathe in the droplets or particles, or they could land on your mouth, nose, \\nor eyes, by touching surfaces or objects that have the virus on them and then touching \\nyour mouth, nose, or eyes. From the pregnant parent to the baby during pregnancy. \\nThrough contaminated food or water. By being bitten by an infected insect or animal. \\nThrough sexual contact (usually vaginal, anal and oral sex) with someone who has the \\ninfection. How do viruses cause disease? Viruses are like hijackers. They invade living, \\nnormal cells. They then use those cells to multiply (make copies of themselves). This \\nprocess is also called replication. The process can kill, damage, or change the infected \\ncells. Sometimes this can make you sick. The symptoms can range from mild to very \\nsevere. Other times, your immune system may be able to fight it off and you may not \\nhave any symptoms. Each different virus usually only infects one type of cell in your \\nbody. For example, hepatitis viruses affect the cells in the liver. HIV infects a certain type \\nof immune system cell. What are the treatments for viral infections? For most viral \\ninfections, treatments can only help with symptoms while you wait for your immune \\nsystem to fight off the virus. There are antiviral medicines to treat some viral infections.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2019', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2019', 'creationdate': '2025-05-14T15:44:39+09:00', 'author': 'Nitrosoft', 'moddate': '2025-05-14T15:44:39+09:00', 'source': 'venv/data/med_data_all.pdf', 'total_pages': 126, 'page': 124, 'page_label': '125'}, page_content=\"Antibiotics do not work for viral infections.

Leukemia starts in \\nblood-forming tissues such as the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes the cells \\nwhich will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell \\nhas a different job: White blood cells help your body fight infection, Red blood cells \\ndeliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs Platelets help form clots to \\nstop bleeding. When you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of \\nabnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal \\ncells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells \\nand make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work. What is acute myeloid \\nleukemia (AML)? Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of acute leukemia. \"Acute\" \\nmeans that the leukemia usually gets worse quickly if it\\'s not treated. In AML, the bone \\nmarrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or \\nplatelets. When the abnormal cells crowd out the healthy cells, it can lead to infection, \\nanemia, and easy bleeding. The abnormal cells can also spread outside the blood to \\nother parts of the body. There are several different subtypes of AML. The subtypes are \\nbased on how developed the cancer cells are when you get your diagnosis and how \\ndifferent they are from normal cells. What causes acute myeloid leukemia (AML)? AML \\nhappens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. \\nThe cause of these genetic changes is unknown. However, there are certain factors that \\nraise your risk of AML. Who is at risk for acute myeloid leukemia (AML)? The factors that \\nraise your risk of AML include: Being male Smoking, especially after age 60Having had \\nchemotherapy or radiation therapy Treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as \\na child Exposure to the chemical benzene. A history of another blood disorder such as \\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. What are the symptoms of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)? \\nThe signs and symptoms of AML include: Fever Shortness of breath Easy bruising or'),\n",

Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose AML and figure \\nout which subtype you have: A physical exam, A medical history Blood tests, such as a \\ncomplete blood count (CBC) and blood smear Bone marrow tests. There are two main \\ntypes - bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy. Both tests involve removing a \\nsample of bone marrow and bone. The samples are sent to a lab for testing. Genetic \\ntests to look for gene and chromosome changes. If you are diagnosed with AML, you \\nmay have additional tests to see whether the cancer has spread.

Adenoids are a patch of tissue that is high up in the throat, just \\nbehind the nose. They, along with the tonsils, are part of the lymphatic system. The \\nlymphatic system clears away infection and keeps body fluids in balance. The adenoids \\nand tonsils work by trapping germs coming in through the mouth and nose. Adenoids \\nusually start to shrink after about age 5. By the teenage years, they are almost \\ncompletely gone. By then, the body has other ways to fight germs. What are enlarged \\nadenoids?

Angioplasty is a procedure to improve blood flow in coronary \\narteries that have become narrow or blocked. Your coronary arteries supply oxygen-rich \\nblood to your heart.

Angioplasty \\nwidens the blocked part of your artery so more blood can get through. It is also called \\npercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). \\n \\nWhat conditions does angioplasty treat?

Thread the tube through the vessel to your heart, \\nusing x-rays as a guide. Inject contrast dye inside your arteries. The dye highlights your \\nheart and blood vessels in the x-rays. Replace the first tube with another one that has a \\nsmall, deflated balloon on the end. Guide the balloon inside the blockage and inflate it \\nto push the plaque flat against the artery wall.

There is no cure for AS, but early treatment can help manage symptoms, \\nslow down the disease, and help you lead a more productive life. Who is more likely to \\nget ankylosing spondylitis? Ankylosing spondylitis usually starts before age 45. Early \\nsymptoms may begin between the ages of 15 and 30. Your chance of developing AS can \\nalso increase if You're a man. AS is more common and severe in men. You have a family \\nhistory. If a member of your family has AS, you're more likely to get the disease.You \\nhave other medical conditions that may increase your risk of getting AS. These include \\nCrohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or psoriasis. What causes ankylosing spondylitis? No \\none knows what causes ankylosing spondylitis, but the environment and genes likely play \\na role. Your genes are parts of DNA in your cells that are passed down from your \\nparents. Certain genes may increase your risk of getting the disease, but not everyone \\nwith these genes gets AS. What are the symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis? AS affects \\npeople differently. The most common symptom is pain and stiffness in the lower back \\nand/or hips. The pain is usually worse during the night or after sitting for a long time. \\nOver time, AS may progress to other areas of your spine or body. Symptoms may \\ndepend on which areas of your body the disease affects. Some people have symptoms \\nthat come and go. Others may have severe, ongoing pain.

A health care provider \\nmay prescribe antidepressants for anxiety, chronic pain, or insomnia. Sometimes \\nproviders also prescribe antidepressants for other conditions. What are the different \\ntypes of antidepressants? There are many types of antidepressants. Each one works \\ndifferently. Providers usually prescribe newer antidepressants first because they don\\'t \\ncause as many side effects as older types. They also seem to help more kinds of \\ndepression and anxiety problems. Most of the newer antidepressants belong to one of \\nthese three groups: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), Serotonin and \\nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), Atypical antidepressants, which are newer \\nantidepressants that don\\'t fit into the other groups.

Global aphasia is the loss of almost all language ability. You can't speak, \\nunderstand speech, read, or write.

But it can be a long-term condition. There's no cure, but \\ntreatment may help improve language skills. What causes aphasia? Aphasia happens \\nfrom damage to one or more parts of the brain involved with language. The damage \\nmay be from: Stroke, which is the most common cause of aphasia Brain tumor, Brain \\ninfection or inflammation, Brain injury, Other brain disorders or neurologic diseases that \\naffect the brain and get worse over time, such as dementia. Who is more likely to \\ndevelop aphasia? Anyone can have aphasia at any age, but most people with aphasia are \\nmiddle-aged or older. Most aphasia happens suddenly from a stroke or brain injury. \\nAphasia from a brain tumor or other brain disorder may develop slowly over time. How \\nis aphasia diagnosed? If a health care provider sees signs of aphasia, the provider will \\nusually: Test the person's ability to understand language and speech. This includes asking \\nquestions and checking to see if the person can follow simple commands. Order an \\nimaging scan to see if there's a brain injury and what part of the brain is damaged. \\nPossible tests include: \\n \\nMRICT scan \\nIf imaging shows signs of aphasia, more tests may be needed. These tests measure how \\nmuch the brain damage has affected the ability to talk, read, write, and understand. In \\nmost cases, the tests are done by a speech-language pathologist or speech therapist (a \\nspecialist who treats speech and communication disorders). What are the treatments for \\naphasia? Some people fully recover from aphasia without treatment. But most people \\nshould begin speech-language therapy to treat aphasia as soon as possible. Treatment \\nmay be one-on-one with a speech therapist or in a group. Therapy using a computer \\nmay also be helpful. The specific therapy depends on the type of language loss that a \\nperson has. It may include exercises in reading, writing, following directions, and \\nrepeating what the therapist says. Therapy may also include learning how to \\ncommunicate with gestures, pictures, smartphones, or other electronic devices. Family \\nparticipation may be an important part of speech therapy.

An AVM is an abnormal tangle of arteries and veins. They are connected to each \\nother, with no capillaries between them. Without the capillaries, the blood flow from the \\narteries goes directly into the veins at a faster rate than normal. Because of this, the \\nnearby tissue does not get all the oxygen it would normally get. This lack of oxygen can \\nlead to tissue damage and the death of nerve cells and other cells. The fast rate of blood \\nflow can also increase the blood pressure inside the arteries and veins. This can weaken \\nthe arteries and veins.

Your immune system protects you from disease and \\ninfection by attacking germs that get into your body, such as viruses and bacteria. Your \\nimmune system can tell that the germs aren\\'t part of you, so it destroys them. If you \\nhave an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks the healthy cells of your \\norgans and tissues by mistake. There are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases. \\nThey can affect almost any part of your body. For example, alopecia areata is an \\nautoimmune disease of the skin that causes hair loss. Autoimmune hepatitis affects the \\nliver. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks the pancreas.  And in rheumatoid \\narthritis, the immune system can attack many parts of the body, including the joints, \\nlungs, and eyes. What causes autoimmune diseases? No one is sure why autoimmune \\ndiseases happen. But you can\\'t catch them from other people. Autoimmune diseases do'),\n",

And if you have one autoimmune disease, you are more likely to get \\nanother. What are the symptoms of autoimmune diseases? The symptoms of an \\nautoimmune disease depend on the part of your body that's affected. Many types of \\nautoimmune diseases cause redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which are the signs and \\nsymptoms of inflammation.  But other il lnesses can cause the same symptoms. The \\nsymptoms of autoimmune diseases can come and go. During a flare-up, your symptoms \\nmay get severe for a while. Later on, you may have a remission, which means that your \\nsymptoms get better or disappear for a period of time. How are autoimmune diseases \\ndiagnosed? Doctors often have a hard time diagnosing autoimmune diseases. There's \\nusually not a specific test to show whether you have a certain autoimmune disease. And \\nthe symptoms can be confusing.

One or more genes might have a change or \\nmutation that prevents them from working properly. For example, this happens in Fragile \\nX syndrome. With some defects, a gene or part of the gene might be missing. \\nChromosomal problems. In some cases, a chromosome or part of a chromosome might \\nbe missing. This is what happens in Turner syndrome. In other cases, such as with Down \\nsyndrome, the child has an extra chromosome. Exposures to medicines, chemicals, or \\nother toxic substances.

The liquid part, called plasma, is made of \\nwater, salts, and protein. Over half of your blood is plasma. The solid part of your blood \\ncontains red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Red blood cells (RBC) deliver \\noxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs. White blood cells (WBC) fight \\ninfection and are part of your immune system. Platelets help blood to clot when you \\nhave a cut or wound. Bone marrow, the spongy material inside your bones, makes new \\nblood cells. Blood cells constantly die and your body makes new ones.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II \\nreceptor blockers (ARBs) keep your blood vessels from narrowing as much and allows \\nblood to move through them with less pressure. Beta blockers help your heart beat \\nslower and with less force. This means that your heart pumps less blood through your \\nblood vessels. Beta blockers are typically used only as a backup option or if you also \\nhave certain other conditions. Calcium channel blockers prevent calcium from entering \\nthe muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows the blood vessels to relax. \\nDiuretics remove extra water and sodium (salt) from your body. This lowers the amount \\nof fluid in your blood.

It is the \\nleading cause of death in the United States in both men and women. CAD happens \\nwhen the arteries that supply blood to heart muscle become hardened and narrowed. \\nThis is due to the buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner \\nwalls. This buildup is called atherosclerosis. As it grows, less blood can flow through the \\narteries. As a result, the heart muscle can't get the blood or oxygen it needs. This can \\nlead to chest pain (angina) or a heart attack.  Most heart attacks happen when a blood \\nclot suddenly cuts off the hearts' blood supply, causing permanent heart damage.  Over \\ntime, CAD can also weaken the heart muscle and contribute to heart failure and \\narrhythmias.

The most commonly used blood pressure medicines work in different ways to \\nlower blood pressure angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II \\nreceptor blockers (ARBs) keep your blood vessels from narrowing as much and allows \\nblood to move through them with less pressure. Beta blockers help your heart beat \\nslower and with less force. This means that your heart pumps less blood through your \\nblood vessels. Beta blockers are typically used only as a backup option or if you also \\nhave certain other conditions. Calcium channel blockers prevent calcium from entering \\nthe muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows the blood vessels to relax. \\nDiuretics remove extra water and sodium (salt) from your body. This lowers the amount \\nof fluid in your blood. Diuretics are often used with other high blood pressure medicines, \\nsometimes in one combined pill. Often, two or more medicines work better than one.

If you have a food intolerance, you \\nalso have symptoms when you eat that food. But these are typically just digestive \\nsymptoms such as bloating and gas. Also, an intolerance is not an immune system \\nreaction. Most food allergies are caused by cow\\'s milk, chicken eggs, crustacean shellfish, \\nsuch as shrimp, crab, lobster, and crayfish, fish peanuts, sesame soy, tree nuts, such as \\nalmonds, walnuts, pecans wheat.

It \\ncould be normal. Some children may be small for their age but still be developing \\nnormally. Some children are short or tall because their parents are. But some children \\nhave growth disorders.  Growth disorders are problems that prevent children from \\ndeveloping normal height, weight, sexual maturity or other features.

Children who \\nhave too little of it may be very short. Treatment with growth hormone can stimulate \\ngrowth. People can also have too much growth hormone. Usually the cause is a pituitary \\ngland tumor, which is not cancer.  Too much growth hormone can cause gigantism in \\nchildren, where their bones and their body grow too much.

The valves have flaps that open and close. The flaps make sure that \\nblood flows in the right direction through your heart and to the rest of your body. When \\nyour heart beats, the flaps open to let blood through. Between heartbeats they close to \\nstop the blood from flowing backwards. If one or more of your heart valves doesn't \\nopen or close correctly, it can affect your blood flow and strain your heart. Fortunately, \\ntreatment helps most valve diseases. What are the types of heart valve diseases? Heart \\nvalves can have three basic kinds of problems such as regurgitation, or backflow, \\nhappens when the flaps of a valve don't close tightly. This allows the blood to leak \\nbackwards. A common cause of regurgitation is prolapse, where the flaps of the valve \\nflop or bulge back. Prolapse most often affects the mitral valve. Stenosis happens when \\nthe flaps of a valve become thick, stiff, or stuck together. This prevents the heart valve \\nfrom opening all the way. Not enough blood can pass through the valve. Aortic valve \\nstenosis is a common type of stenosis. It affects the valve that controls blood flow into \\nthe large artery that carries blood out of the heart to the body. Atresia happens when a \\nheart valve did not form properly and does not have an opening for blood to pass \\nthrough. Sometimes a valve can have both regurgitation and stenosis. What causes heart \\nvalve diseases? Some people are born with heart valve disease. This is called congenital \\nheart valve disease. It can happen alone or along with other congenital heart defects. \\nHeart valve disease can also develop over time as you get older or have certain \\nconditions that affect the heart. Who is more likely to develop heart valve diseases? Your \\nchance of having heart valve disease is higher if you are older. With age, the heart valves \\ncan become thick and stiff. You have or have had other conditions that affect your heart \\nand blood vessels. These include: \\nRheumatic fever. An untreated strep throat can become rheumatic fever, which can harm \\nthe heart valves. The damage may not show up for years.

What are the symptoms of heart valve diseases? Many people live their whole \\nlives with a heart valve that doesn't work perfectly and never have any problems.

If you don't get treatment for heart valve disease, the symptoms \\nand strain on your heart may keep getting worse. What other problems can heart valve \\ndiseases cause? When the valves don't work well, your heart has to pump harder to get \\nenough blood out to the body.  Without treatment, this extra workload on your heart \\ncan lead to heart failure, stroke blood clots, sudden cardiac arrest or death. How is heart \\nvalve disease diagnosed? Your health care provider may listen to your heart with a \\nstethoscope and hear that your heart makes abnormal sounds, such as a click or a heart \\nmurmur. These sounds may mean a valve isn't working normally. The provider will \\nusually refer you to a cardiologist, a doctor who specializes in heart diseases. The doctor \\nwill also listen to your heart and will do a physical exam. You will also likely need to have \\none or more heart tests. What are the treatments for heart valve diseases? Most heart \\nvalve problems can be treated successfully. Treatment may include medicines to control \\nyour symptoms and keep your heart pumping well, heart-healthy lifestyle changes to \\ntreat other related heart conditions, surgery to repair or replace a valve. It's possible that \\nyou may need surgery, even if you don't have symptoms. Fixing the valve can help \\nprevent future heart problems. There are many ways to do heart valve surgery. You and \\nyour doctor can decide what's best for you, based on your valve problem and general \\nhealth. Heart valve repair surgery has fewer risks than heart valve replacement. So, when \\nrepair is possible, it's preferred over valve replacement. In some cases, valve replacement \\nis necessary. There are 2 types of replacement valves such as biologic valves made from \\npig, cow, or human tissue. These valves tend to wear out after 10 to 15 years, but some \\nmay last longer. Mechanical (human-made) valves usually don't wear out. But with a \\nmechanical valve, you usually have to take blood thinners for the rest of your life to \\nprevent blood clots.

It may include different types of abuse, such as physical \\nviolence, which is when a person hurts or tries to hurt a partner by hitting, kicking, or \\nusing another type of physical force, sexual violence which involves forcing or attempting \\nto force a partner to take part in sexual activity when the partner does not or cannot \\nconsent. The sexual activity could include things like sex acts, sexual touching, or non-\\nphysical sexual events (e.g., sexting), and emotional abuse, which includes threats, name-\\ncalling, put-downs, and humiliation. It can also involve controlling behavior, such as \\ntelling a partner how to act or dress and not letting them see family or friends. Economic \\nabuse, also called financial abuse, involves controlling access to money. Stalking, which is \\nrepeated, unwanted contact that causes fear or concern for the safety of the partner. \\nThis can include watching or following the partner. The stalker may send repeated, \\nunwanted phone calls or texts. Who is affected by intimate partner violence (IPV)? It is \\nhard to know exactly how common IPV is because it is often not reported. But we do \\nknow that IPV can happen to anyone. It affects people with all levels of income and \\neducation. What are the signs that someone is experiencing intimate partner violence \\n(IPV)? If you think that a loved one might be experiencing IPV, watch for these signs, \\ndoes your friend or loved one have unexplained cuts or bruises? Avoid friends, family, \\nand favorite activities?

But most treatments include medicines and therapies to relieve pain and \\nother symptoms. What types of joint disorders happen from sudden injuries? Joint \\ndisorders from sudden injuries include sprains and strains. Sprains are stretched or torn \\nligaments. Acute strains are stretched or torn muscles or tendons that happen from a \\nsudden injury or movement, such as lifting a heavy object. Dislocated joints.

Problems from knee joints that aren't \\nformed correctly. What happens during knee replacement surgery? During the surgery, a \\nsurgeon removes damaged cartilage and some bone from the surfaces of your knee \\njoint. Cartilage is tissue that covers your bones where they meet. Healthy cartilage is \\nsmooth and helps the bones glide over each other when you move. When cartilage \\nbecomes rough and wears away, the bones rub against each other, causing pain. After \\nremoving the damaged knee cartilage and bone, the surgeon attaches the artificial parts \\nto your bones. The artificial parts are made of metal and plastic. They will give your knee \\nnew, smooth surfaces. Knee replacement surgery may replace all the damaged parts of \\nyour knee (total knee replacement) or just part of your knee (partial knee replacement). \\nIn a total knee replacement, the surgeon replaces 3 surfaces, the end of the shinbone, \\nthe end of the thigh, bone, and the back of the kneecap. What happens after knee \\nreplacement surgery? Some people go home the same day they have surgery. Other \\npeople will stay in the hospital a few days. To help prevent blood clots, you'll most likely \\ntake blood thinners and wear special socks or coverings on your legs for a short time \\nafter surgery.

There are two kinds simple fatty liver, in which you have fat \\nin your liver but little or no inflammation or liver cell damage. Simple fatty liver typically \\ndoes not get bad enough to cause liver damage or complications. Nonalcoholic \\nsteatohepatitis (NASH), in which you have inflammation and liver cell damage, as well as \\nfat in your liver. Inflammation and liver cell damage can cause fibrosis, or scarring, of the \\nliver. NASH may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer. What is alcoholic fatty liver disease? \\nAlcoholic fatty liver disease is due to heavy alcohol use. Your liver breaks down most of \\nthe alcohol you drink, so it can be removed from your body. But the process of breaking \\nit down can generate harmful substances. These substances can damage liver cells, \\npromote inflammation, and weaken your body's natural defenses. The more alcohol that \\nyou drink, the more you damage your liver.  Alcoholic fatty liver disease is the earliest \\nstage of alcohol-related liver disease. The next stages are alcoholic hepatitis and \\ncirrhosis. Who is at risk for fatty liver disease? The cause of nonalcoholic fatty liver \\ndisease (NAFLD) is unknown. Researchers know that it is more common among people \\nwith type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, or obesity, as well as those who are middle-aged or \\nolder (though children can also be affected). It is most frequent in Hispanic individuals, \\nfollowed by non-Hispanic Whites. It is less common in African Americans. Having high \\nlevels of fats in the blood, such as cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as high blood \\npressure, can increase the risk of developing Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). \\nCertain drugs, such as corticosteroids and some cancer treatments, may also contribute \\nto this condition. Additionally, metabolic disorders, including metabolic syndrome, rapid \\nweight loss, and specific infections like hepatitis C, are recognized as risk factors. \\nExposure to certain toxins can further raise the likelihood of developing NAFLD. Globally, \\nthis disease affects approximately 25% of the population.  \\nAs the rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and high cholesterol are rising in the United \\nStates, so is the rate of NAFLD. NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disorder in the \\nUnited States. Alcoholic fatty liver disease only happens in people who are heavy \\ndrinkers, especially those who have been drinking for a long period of time.

To make a diagnosis, your \\ndoctor will use your medical history, a physical exam, and various tests, including blood \\nand imaging tests, and sometimes a biopsy. As part of the medical history, your doctor \\nwill ask about your alcohol use, to find out whether fat in your liver is a sign of alcoholic \\nfatty liver disease or nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD). He or she will also ask which \\nmedicines you take, to try to determine whether a medicine is causing your NAFLD. \\nDuring the physical exam, your doctor will examine your body and check your weight \\nand height. Your doctor will look for signs of fatty liver disease, such as an enlarged liver \\nsigns of cirrhosis, such as jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and whites of your \\neyes to turn yellow. You will likely have blood tests, including liver function tests and \\nblood count tests. In some cases you may also have imaging tests, like those that check \\nfor fat in the liver and the stiffness of your liver. Liver stiffness can mean fibrosis, which is \\nscarring of the liver. In some cases you may also need a liver biopsy to confirm the \\ndiagnosis, and to check how bad the liver damage is. What are the treatments for fatty \\nliver disease? Doctors recommend weight loss for nonalcoholic fatty liver. Weight loss \\ncan reduce fat in the liver, inflammation, and fibrosis. If your doctor thinks that a certain \\nmedicine is the cause of your NAFLD, you should stop taking that medicine.  But check \\nwith your doctor before stopping the medicine. You may need to get off the medicine \\ngradually, and you might need to switch to another medicine instead. There are no \\nmedicines that have been approved to treat NAFLD. Studies are investigating whether a \\ncertain diabetes medicine or Vitamin E can help, but more studies are needed. The most \\nimportant part of treating alcohol-related fatty liver disease is to stop drinking alcohol. If \\nyou need help doing that, you may want to see a therapist or participate in an alcohol \\nrecovery program. There are also medicines that can help, either by reducing your \\ncravings or making you feel sick if you drink alcohol. Both alcoholic fatty liver disease \\nand one type of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) can lead to \\ncirrhosis. Doctors can treat the health problems caused by cirrhosis with medicines, \\noperations, and other medical procedures. If the cirrhosis leads to liver failure, you may \\nneed a liver transplant.

Respiratory failure is a condition in which your blood doesn't \\nhave enough oxygen or has too much carbon dioxide. Sometimes you can have both \\nproblems. When you breathe, your lungs take in oxygen. The oxygen passes into your \\nblood, which carries it to your organs. Your organs, such as your heart and brain, need \\nthis oxygen-rich blood to work well. Another part of breathing is removing the carbon \\ndioxide from the blood and breathing it out. Having too much carbon dioxide in your \\nblood can harm your organs. What causes respiratory failure? Conditions that affect your \\nbreathing can cause respiratory failure. These conditions may affect the muscles, nerves, \\nbones, or tissues that support breathing. Or they may affect the lungs directly. These \\nconditions include diseases that affect the lungs, such as COPD (chronic obstructive \\npulmonary disease), cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and COVID-\\n19Conditions that affect the nerves and muscles that control breathing, such as \\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), muscular dystrophy, spinal cord injuries, and stroke \\nproblems with the spine, such as scoliosis (a curve in the spine).

They also may \\nhave arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat). You may have these symptoms if your brain and \\nheart are not getting enough oxygen. How is respiratory failure diagnosed? Your health \\ncare provider will diagnose respiratory failure based on your medical history. A physical \\nexam, which often includes listening to your lungs to check for abnormal sounds, \\nlistening to your heart to check for arrhythmia, looking for a bluish color on your skin, \\nlips, and fingernails, diagnostic tests, such as pulse oximetry, a small sensor that uses a \\nlight to measure how much oxygen is in your blood. The sensor goes on the end of your \\nfinger or on your ear. Arterial blood gas test, a test that measures the oxygen and \\ncarbon dioxide levels in your blood. The blood sample is taken from an artery, usually in \\nyour wrist. Once you are diagnosed with respiratory failure, your provider will look for \\nwhat is causing it. Tests for this often include a chest x-ray. If your provider thinks you \\nmay have arrhythmia because of the respiratory failure, you may have an EKG \\n(electrocardiogram). This is simple, painless test that detects and records your heart's \\nelectrical activity. What are the treatments for respiratory failure? Treatment for \\nrespiratory failure depends on whether it is acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing), how \\nsevere it is, and what is causing it. Acute respiratory failure can be a medical emergency. \\nYou may need treatment in intensive care unit at a hospital. Chronic respiratory failure \\ncan often be treated at home.

Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a condition in which \\nthe heart suddenly stops beating. When that happens, blood stops flowing to the brain \\nand other vital organs. If it is not treated, SCA usually causes death within minutes. But \\nquick treatment with a defibrillator may be lifesaving. How is sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) \\ndifferent from a heart attack? A heart attack is different from an SCA. A heart attack \\nhappens when blood flow to the heart is blocked. During a heart attack, the heart usually \\ndoesn't suddenly stop beating. With an SCA, the heart stops beating. Sometimes an SCA \\ncan happen after or during recovery from a heart attack. What causes sudden cardiac \\narrest (SCA)? Your heart has an electrical system that controls the rate and rhythm of \\nyour heartbeat.  An SCA can happen when the heart's electrical system is not working \\nright and causes irregular heartbeats. Irregular heartbeats are called arrhythmias. There \\nare different types. They may cause the heart to beat too fast, too slow, or with an \\nirregular rhythm. Some can cause the heart to stop pumping blood to the body; this is \\nthe type that causes SCA. Certain diseases and conditions can cause the electrical \\nproblems that lead to SCA. They include ventricular fibrillation, a type of arrhythmia \\nwhere the ventricles (the heart's lower chambers) don't beat normally. Instead, they beat \\nvery fast and very irregularly. They can't pump blood to the body. This causes most \\nSCAs. Coronary artery disease (CAD), also called ischemic heart disease. CAD happens \\nwhen the arteries of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart. It is \\noften caused by the buildup of plaque, a waxy substance, inside the lining of larger \\ncoronary arteries. The plaque blocks some or all of the blood flow to the heart. Some \\ntypes of physical stress can cause your heart's electrical system to fail, such as: \\n• Intense physical activity in which your body releases the hormone adrenaline. This \\nhormone can trigger SCA in people who have heart problems. \\n• Very low blood levels of potassium or magnesium, as these minerals play an\"),\n",

Heart infections can also cause changes to \\nthe structure of the heart. \\n \\nYou are at a higher risk for SCA if you: \\n• Have coronary artery disease (CAD). Most people with SCA have CAD, but CAD \\nusually does not cause symptoms, so you may not know that you have it. \\n• Are older, as your risk increases with age. \\n• Are a man, since SCA is more common in men than in women. \\n• Are Black or African American, especially if you have other conditions such as \\ndiabetes, high blood pressure, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. \\n• Have a personal history of irregular heartbeats (arrhythmia). \\n• Have a personal or family history of SCA or inherited disorders that can cause \\narrhythmia. \\n• Have a problem with drug or alcohol use. \\n• Have had a heart attack. \\n• Have heart failure. \\n \\nWhat are the symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? Usually, the first sign of SCA is \\nloss of consciousness (fainting). This happens when the heart stops beating. Some \\npeople may have a racing heartbeat or feel dizzy or light-headed just before they faint. \\nAnd sometimes people have chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting in the \\nhour before they have an SCA. How is sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) diagnosed? SCA \\nhappens without warning and requires emergency treatment. Health care providers rarely \\ndiagnose SCA with medical tests as it's happening. Instead, it is usually diagnosed after it \\nhappens. Providers do this by ruling out other causes of a person's sudden collapse. If \\nyou are at high risk for SCA, your provider may refer you to a cardiologist, a doctor who \\nspecializes in heart diseases.

A defibrillator is a device sends an electric shock to the heart. \\nThe electric shock can restore a normal rhythm to a heart that's stopped beating. To \\nwork well, it needs to be done within minutes of the SCA. Most police officers, \\nemergency medical technicians, and other first responders are trained and equipped to \\nuse a defibrillator. Call 9-1-1 right away if someone has signs or symptoms of SCA. The \\nsooner you call for help, the sooner lifesaving treatment can begin. What should I do if I \\nthink that someone has had an SCA? Many public places such as schools, businesses, \\nand airports have automated external defibrillators (AEDs). AEDs are special defibrillators \\nthat untrained people can use if they think that someone has had SCA. AEDS are \\nprogrammed to give an electric shock if they detect a dangerous arrhythmia. This \\nprevents giving a shock to someone who may have fainted but isn't having SCA. If you \\nsee someone who you think has had SCA, you should give cardiopulmonary resuscitation \\n(CPR) until defibrillation can be done. People who are at risk for SCA may want to \\nconsider having an AED at home. Ask your cardiologist to help you decide whether \\nhaving an AED in your home might help you. What are the treatments after surviving \\nsudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? If you survive SCA, you'll likely be admitted to a hospital for \\nongoing care and treatment. In the hospital, your medical team will closely watch your \\nheart. They may give you medicines to try to reduce the risk of another SCA. They will \\nalso try to find out what caused your SCA. If you're diagnosed with coronary artery \\ndisease, you may have an angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery. These \\nprocedures help restore blood flow through narrowed or blocked coronary arteries. \\nOften, people who have had SCA get a device called an implantable cardioverter \\ndefibrillator (ICD). This small device is surgically placed under the skin in your chest or \\nabdomen. An ICD uses electric pulses or shocks to help control dangerous arrhythmias. \\nCan sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) be prevented? You may be able to lower your risk of \\nSCA by following a heart-healthy lifestyle. If you have coronary artery disease or another \\nheart disease, treating that disease can also lower your risk of SCA.

Don't twist or jerk the tick. You want to \\nremove the whole tick in one piece if you can. If the mouth-parts of the tick break off \\nand stay in the skin, try to remove them. But if you can't remove them easily, then leave \\nthem. Thoroughly clean the bite area and your hands with rubbing alcohol or soap and \\nwater. When do I need to contact my health care provider about a tick bite? Many \\ntickborne diseases can have similar signs and symptoms. The most common are fever \\nchills aches and pains rash. If you develop any of these symptoms within several weeks \\nof removing a tick, contact your provider. How can I prevent tick bites? There are steps \\nyou can take to prevent tick bites: \\n• Avoid wooded, brushy, and grassy areas, especially during warmer months. \\n• Wear insect repellent with DEET, picaridin or another U.S. Environmental \\nProtection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent. \\n• Wear light-colored protective clothing. \\n• Treat your clothing and gear with products containing 0.5% permethrin. \\n• Tuck your pant legs into your socks and your shirt into your pants. \\n• Remove your clothing after being outdoors.  \\n• Check your clothing for ticks and remove any ticks that you find.

Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you \\ntake to teach the immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. The \\ngerms could be viruses or bacteria. Some types of vaccines contain germs that cause \\ndisease. But the germs have been killed or weakened enough that they won\\'t make your \\nchild sick. Some vaccines only contain a part of a germ. Other types of vaccines include \\ninstructions for your cells to make a protein of the germ. These different vaccine types all \\nspark an immune response, which helps the body fight off the germs. Your child\\'s \\nimmune system will also remember the germ and attack it if that germ ever invades \\nagain. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity. Why do I need to \\nvaccinate my child? Babies are born with immune systems that can fight most germs, but \\nthere are some serious diseases they can\\'t handle. That\\'s why they need vaccines to \\nstrengthen their immune system. These diseases once killed or harmed many infants, \\nchildren, and adults. But now with vaccines, your child can get immunity from these \\ndiseases without having to get sick. And for a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can'),\n",

Vaccinating \\nyour child also protects others. Normally, germs can travel quickly through a community \\nand make a lot of people sick. If enough people get sick, it can lead to an outbreak. But \\nwhen enough people are vaccinated against a certain disease, it\\'s harder for that disease \\nto spread to others. The entire community is less likely to get the disease. This is called \\n\"community immunity. \"Community immunity is especially important for the people who \\ncan\\'t get certain vaccines. For example, they may not be able to get a vaccine because \\nthey have weakened immune systems. Others may be allergic to certain vaccine \\ningredients. And newborn babies are too young to get some vaccines. Community \\nimmunity can help to protect them all. Are vaccines safe for children? Vaccines are safe. \\nThey must go through extensive safety testing and evaluation before they are approved \\nin the United States. Some people worry that childhood vaccines could cause autism \\nspectrum disorder (ASD). But many scientific studies have looked at this and have found \\nno link between vaccines and autism. Can vaccines overload my child\\'s immune system? \\nNo, vaccines do not overload the immune system. Every day, a healthy child\\'s immune \\nsystem successfully fights off thousands of germs. When your child gets vaccines, they \\nare getting weakened or dead germs. So even if they get several vaccines in one day, \\nthey are being exposed to a tiny amount of germs compared to what they encounter \\nevery day in their environment. When do I need to vaccinate my child? Your child will \\nget vaccines during well-child visits. They will be given according to the vaccine \\nschedule. This schedule lists which vaccines are recommended for children. It includes \\nwho should get the vaccines, how many doses they need, and at what age they should \\nget them. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \\npublishes the vaccine schedule. Following the vaccine schedule allows your child to get \\nprotection from the diseases at exactly the right time.

It happens when the body\\'s immune \\nsystem attacks the blood vessel by mistake. It can happen because of an infection, a \\nmedicine, or another disease. The cause is often unknown.

Sometimes the injuries are \\nlife-threatening or serious enough to cause disability. Others may not be as serious, but \\nthey may be painful and can affect daily life. Some of the specific types of injuries that \\nservice members may face include sprains and strains, especially in the ankles and knees. \\nThese injuries are often caused by exercise and running. Back and shoulder injuries, often \\nfrom lifting and carrying. Tinnitus and hearing loss, typically from exposure to noise. \\nHead injuries and traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). Shrapnel and gunshot wounds. Lost \\nlimbs. What other special health problems do service members face? There may also be \\na risk of health problems from exposure to environmental hazards, such as contaminated \\nwater, chemicals, infections, and burn pits. Sometimes the health problems caused by \\nexposures don't develop until years later. Some service members experience military \\nsexual trauma (MST). This includes sexual assault and sexual harassment. What mental \\nhealth issues do service members and veterans face? Being in combat and being \\nseparated from your family can be stressful. So can readjusting to civilian life after the \\nmilitary.

Viruses are very tiny germs. They are made of genetic material (either \\nDNA or RNA) inside of a protein coating. There are a huge number of viruses on earth. \\nOnly a small number of them can infect humans. Those viruses can infect our cells, which \\nmay cause disease. Some of the diseases that viruses can cause include the common \\ncold, the flu, COVID-19. How are viruses spread? Viruses can be spread in different ways, \\nthrough droplets and particles that are breathed out by someone who has the infection. \\nYou might breathe in the droplets or particles, or they could land on your mouth, nose, \\nor eyes, by touching surfaces or objects that have the virus on them and then touching \\nyour mouth, nose, or eyes. From the pregnant parent to the baby during pregnancy. \\nThrough contaminated food or water. By being bitten by an infected insect or animal. \\nThrough sexual contact (usually vaginal, anal and oral sex) with someone who has the \\ninfection. How do viruses cause disease? Viruses are like hijackers. They invade living, \\nnormal cells. They then use those cells to multiply (make copies of themselves). This \\nprocess is also called replication. The process can kill, damage, or change the infected \\ncells. Sometimes this can make you sick. The symptoms can range from mild to very \\nsevere. Other times, your immune system may be able to fight it off and you may not \\nhave any symptoms. Each different virus usually only infects one type of cell in your \\nbody. For example, hepatitis viruses affect the cells in the liver. HIV infects a certain type \\nof immune system cell. What are the treatments for viral infections? For most viral \\ninfections, treatments can only help with symptoms while you wait for your immune \\nsystem to fight off the virus. There are antiviral medicines to treat some viral infections.\"),\n",
